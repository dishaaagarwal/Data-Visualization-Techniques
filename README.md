# Data-Visualization-Techniques



## Main Objective

The main objective of this repository is to provide basic insight about the Data Visualization Techiques in Python.

## Overview

The main aim of Data Visualization is to gain insights from the data in order to understand the Business Problem more effectively.Data visualization in python is perhaps one of the most utilized features for data science with python in todayâ€™s day and age. The libraries in python come with lots of different features that enable users to make highly customized, elegant, and interactive plots.

For this article I have mainly used **Matplotlib and Seaborn** libraries to perform Data Visualization.


### Pie Charts

Pie charts can be used to identify proportions of the different components in a given whole.

### Line Charts

A line chart is used for the representation of continuous data points. This visual can be effectively utilized when we want to understand the trend across time.

### Scatter Plots

Scatter plots can be leveraged to identify relationships between two variables.

### Histograms

Histograms are used to observe the distribution for a single variable with few data points.

### Box Plots

A box plot is used to show the shape of the distribution, its central value, and its variability.
